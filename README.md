# Omni Forms

Omni forms is a simple form builder with admin integration for django versions >= 1.8 that allows you to easily create forms for your django website.

`pip install omniforms`

Once the package has been installed just add `omni_forms` to `INSTALLED_APPS` in your settings file:

`INSTALLED_APPS += ('omni_forms',)`

Once you've done this run `python manage.py migrate` to migrate your database.

## Configuration

The OmniForms application can be configured in a number of different ways:

### Permitted content types

You may not want administrators to be able to create forms for _all_ different types of content in your database.  There are 2 different ways of restricting the types of content that can be associated with model forms created through the admin interface:


## OMNI_FORMS_CONTENT_TYPES

It is possible to define specific apps and/or models which can be used by the omniforms app using the `OMNI_FORMS_CONTENT_TYPES` setting.

For example:

The following configuration would allow _any_ of the models in the app `foo` and the `modelone` and `modeltwo` models within the `bar` app to be used.

```
OMNI_FORMS_CONTENT_TYPES = [
    {'app_label': 'foo'},
    {'app_label': 'bar', 'model': 'modelone'},
    {'app_label': 'bar', 'model': 'modeltwo'},
]
```

If the `OMNI_FORMS_CONTENT_TYPES` setting is not defined it will default to `None` and the `OMNI_FORMS_EXCLUDED_CONTENT_TYPES` setting will be used instead (default values or otherwise).


## OMNI_FORMS_EXCLUDED_CONTENT_TYPES

It is possible to prevent model forms from being created for specific apps or specific models using the `OMNI_FORMS_EXCLUDED_CONTENT_TYPES` setting.

For example:

The following configuration would prevent forms being created for _any_ of the models in the app `foo` and for the `modelone` and `modeltwo` models within the `bar` app.

```
OMNI_FORMS_EXCLUDED_CONTENT_TYPES = [
    {'app_label': 'foo'},
    {'app_label': 'bar', 'model': 'modelone'},
    {'app_label': 'bar', 'model': 'modeltwo'},
]
```

If you do not specify this setting it will default to the following:

```
OMNI_FORMS_EXCLUDED_CONTENT_TYPES = [
    {'app_label': 'omniforms'}
]
```

This will prevent administrators from creating form_builder forms with the formbuilder itself.
It's worth mentioning that allowing administrators to do this represents a potential security risk and should be avoided.
As such, if you need to define your own `OMNI_FORMS_EXCLUDED_CONTENT_TYPES` setting it would be wise to exclude all `omniforms` models as shown above.


## OMNI_FORMS_CUSTOM_FIELD_MAPPING

Although the omniforms app accounts for the majority of use cases you may have models that use custom model fields.  In these instances the form builder will not be able to map a model field to a form field and you will need to provide a custom field mapping using the `OMNI_FORMS_CUSTOM_FIELD_MAPPING` setting.

 - Each key within the mapping dictionary must be a string (python dotted import path) to a model field class.
 - Each value within the mapping dictionary must be a string (python dotted import path) to an OmniField subclass.

For example, you can map a TagField to an OmniCharField model instance using the following configuration:

```
OMNI_FORMS_CUSTOM_FIELD_MAPPING = {
    'taggit.TagField': 'omniforms.models.OmniCharField',
}
```

With this configuration any instances of taggit.TagField on your models will be represented as charfields in the corresponding forms generated by omniforms.

It is also possible to create your own OmniField subclasses to use in your custom form builders.  For example:

```
OMNI_FORMS_CUSTOM_FIELD_MAPPING = {
    'taggit.TagField': 'my_app.MySuperOmniField',
}
```

It is important to note that the dictionary values defined within the `OMNI_FORMS_CUSTOM_FIELD_MAPPING` MUST be subclasses of `omniforms.models.OmniField`.  If you attempt to register Field handlers that do not subclass `omniforms.models.OmniField` an ImproperlyConfigured exception will be raised.

## Wagtail Integration

If you would like to integrate the form builder with [Wagtail](https://wagtail.io/) you will need to add the `omniforms.wagtail` submodule to your applications `INSTALLED_APPS` setting as well as the `omniforms` module e.g.

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'omniforms',
    'omniforms.wagtail',
    ...
]
```

Once this has been done, run database migrations `python manage.py migrate` and away you go.

### Customizing wagtail admin forms

In some cases it may be desirable to customize the form class that wagtail uses for a custom related model type (i.e. an OmniForm Field or OmniForm Handler model). If this is desirable, the custom form class needs to be assigned to a `base_form_class` property on the model. e.g.

```
class MyOmniFieldForm(forms.ModelForm):
    def clean_name(self, value):
        if value.contains("something"):
            raise ValidationError("The field name cannot contain the word 'something'")
        return value

class MyOmniField(OmniField):
    base_form_class = MyOmniFieldForm
```

It is worth noting that the `base_form_class` _must_ subclass `django.forms.ModelForm`.  You do _not_ need to specify the model that the form is for (using the forms meta class) as this will be generated dynamically when the form class is created.

### Preventing forms from being changed or cloned

It may be desirable for forms to be locked under certain conditions.  For example, if a form has been set up for data collection, and has already collected data, you may want to prevent the form from being modified or deleted.  For this purpose we have added a custom wagtail hook which can be used to implement logic to prevent the form from being edited further.

The hook name is 'omniform_permission_check' and is registered like any other wagtail hook. The hook takes 3 positional arguments:

 - action: The type of action being performed on the form (clone, update, delete);
 - instance: The form instance
 - user: The currently logged in user

Example:

```
from wagtail.wagtailcore import hooks

@hooks.register('omniform_permission_check')
def lock_form(action, form, user):
    if action in ['update', 'delete'] and form.some_relationship.count() > 0:
        raise PermissionDenied
```
